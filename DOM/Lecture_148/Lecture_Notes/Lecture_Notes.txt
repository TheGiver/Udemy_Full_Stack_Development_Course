Lecture Title: Adding JS to Website
-----------------------------------
Methods of integration:
There exists 3 methods to integrate JS code into our websites and those approaches are:
(a) Inline JS
(b) Internal 
(c) External 

Note that all 3 methods will be shown in the src file. 
-----------------------------------
Tip:
It is advised that the we add the JS script at the bottom of the code right before the 
</body> tag. There are 2 reasons as to why we should do this:
(1) Decrease the chance of error that will rise from the fact that we are attempting to 
    change an element that does not exist or has not yet been created. 
(2) Make the website load its content faster as JS code takes some time to run. By doing so, 
    we give priority to the UI to load before the interactive part of the website which is
    a desired property to have.

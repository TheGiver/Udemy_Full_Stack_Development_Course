Lecture Title: Selecting HTML Elements with JS
----------------------------------
Functions to manipulate elements:

There exists multiple methods that allow us as developers to search, retrieve and manipulate 
html elements. Functions include:
a. document.getElementsByTagName()
b. document.getElementsByClassName()
c. document.getElementsById()
d. document.querySelector()
e. document.querySelectorAll() 

The querySelector(All) approach is used more often as it gives developers a greater degree of freedom 
and ability to perform more powerful, useful and targeted searches.

Challenge:
We were given a challenge to change the text color of the item that says 'GOOGLE' to red 
using javascript.

Note:
I have provided a snipper of a bunch of JS code that I wrote to practise manipulating html 
elements via JS. 
The JS snippet is titled 'script.js'

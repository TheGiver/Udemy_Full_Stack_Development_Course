Lecture Title: The Separation of Concerns
-----------------------------------------
Note:
In coding, especially web-development, it is important to keep the structure, style and behaviour 
separate as to keep the code clean, maintainable and easy to debug. Therefore, it is important to 
avoid using JS for style manipulation. 
-----------------------------------------
classList:
This feature will allow you to retrieve the list of css classes that belong to a particular element 
or group of elements. 

You can then use this feature to add, remove or toggle css classes which will cause visible changes 
to the element(s) specified. 
-----------------------------------------
Challenge:
For this challenge, we were asked to create a new css element called huge which will change the text
size to 10rem.

We were then asked to use the classList to add this class to the <h1> element. 

The solution can be found in the script under the title 'script.js'

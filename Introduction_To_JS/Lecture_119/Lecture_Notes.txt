Operations in JS:
Just like any programming language, JS has the same type of mathematical 
operations which are:
(a) Multiplication
(b) Division
(c) Modulo
(d) Addition
(e) Subtraction
------------------------------------
Operation Precedence:
Just like in maths, JS follows the same operation precedence which is:

Challenge:
We have been given a challenge were we are required to convert a dog's age 
into human age. 

I am assuming that we need to take in input from the user and use that input 
to perform the calculation according to the formula provided. 

Please note that the code for this challenge will be provided in a separate 
script titled 'snippet.js'.

Lecture Title: String Length Property
-------------------------------------
Adding comments:
There are 2 ways to add comments in JS. The first way involves the use 
of '//' which allows you to add a single-line comment. 

The second way is to make use of '/* */' which allows you to add multi-lined
comments. 
-------------------------------------
Length property:
Sometimes you would like to retrieve the length of a string to accomplish a specific 
task. The length property and its usage are illustrated in the js document provided 
as part of the lecture's materials/resources. 

An example where the string length matters is when writing tweets. Twitter restricts 
the total number of characters in a tweet to ensure that all tweets are concise and 
that information reaches people in the most efficient way possible.

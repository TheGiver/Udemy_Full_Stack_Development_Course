Lecture Title: Introduction to JS
---------------------------------
A little bit of history:
In the past, websites used to be used to display information rather than allowing 
interaction to occur between the html elements and between the user and the webpage 
itself. 

Before JS was invented, if you wanted to make a webpage interactive, then the website 
had to request the new content and new display from a server rather doing stuff locally. 
This approach is not feasible anymore as it will slow the responsivness of the website. 
---------------------------------
What is JS?
JS is a scripting language that is used to make webpages more interactive and more dynamic. 
So, instead of just being used to display information, webpages can now dynamically update 
its content by performing functions at a local level. 
---------------------------------
Where does JS lie?
JS lies on the client side rather than the server side and it listens to events triggered by 
users interacting with the website. The script then applies some logic to the webpage locally.

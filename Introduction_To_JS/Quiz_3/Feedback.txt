General Feedback:
I have been able to solve 2/3 questions on my own but made a 
mistake on my very last question. 
---------------------------------------
My Mistake:
The question that I have been given was as follows:

What does y  equal?

var x = 3;
var y = x++;
y += 1;

I have thought that the value would be 5 but apparently it is 4 and the reason 
is because in line 13 y gets assigned the value of 3 and then x gets incremented 
by one. This suggests that after line 13 has been executed, y would have the value 
of 3 and x would have the value of 4.

Lecture Title: JS Datatypes
---------------------------
List of datatypes:
In JS there are 3 main datatypes and those are:
(a) String
(b) Numbers
(c) Boolean
---------------------------
Extending of alert():
I have mentioned before that alert() accepts a string as parameters but
apparently it accepts operations as well such as alert(2+3). 

So the parameter is not restricted to strings. 
---------------------------
Introduction of typeof():
This function takes in any type of data and informs us the datatype of the 
input. 

Example:
< typeof(true)
> Boolean

< typeof(2)
> Number

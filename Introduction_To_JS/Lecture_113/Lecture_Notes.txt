Lecture Title: JS Naming Rules & Conventions
--------------------------------------------
Naming Rules:
The naming rules are really similar to rules in other programming 
languages. The rules are:
(a) The variable name cannot be var but could contain the word var
(b) The variable name cannot be a keyword used as part of the language
(c) The variable name cannot contain spaces and cannot start with a number 
--------------------------------------------
Naming Conventions:
We will be using camel casing as a naming convention. But, what is camel 
casing?

Camel casing states that the variable names will always start with a lower-cased 
word and then every subsequent word that follows will start with a capital letter. 
--------------------------------------------
Note:
As usual, variable names need to be meaningful and representitive in order to make the 
code both readable and maintainable.

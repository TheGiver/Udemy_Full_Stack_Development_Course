Lecture Title: Selector Priority
--------------------------------
Priority within an element:
Assume that we have a css file and inside one css element we duplicated a property with 
two different values, then the very last value is the one that overrides the previous ones. 
The reason is in the way the compiler reads the file {top to bottom approach}.
--------------------------------
Selector Priority:
By selector priority we are suggesting that certain selectors take higher priority over 
other selectors. Let us assume that we have a css file with the following:

h1 {
    color: blue;
}

.heading {
    color: green;
}

#title-section {
    color: yellow;
}

The id takes the highest priority, followed by the heading and then h1.

Lecture Title: Z-index and Stacking Order
------------------------------------------
Introduction:
In html, there exists a concept also known as the stacking order. This concept 
says that elements on a webpage appear in the same order they are defined in the 
html script. This is the natural stacking order of elements, but of course we have 
the ability to disrupt this order using a features such as the z-index and the 
positioning of elements. 
------------------------------------------
Definition of z-index:
The z-index is a css feature that assists in specifying the stacking order of elements. 
It is basically used to place elements on top of each other. So, rather than changing the 
x or y coordinates, we change the z coordinate, hence moving the element backwards or front-
wards towards the screen. 
------------------------------------------
Imp. Note:
The z-index only works on positioned elements 
[Absolute, Relative, Fixed, Sticky]
------------------------------------------
Default z-index Value:
The default value is zero. But, you can also specify positive or negative values.

Lecture Title: CSS Selectors
----------------------------
Introduction:
We use CSS selectors as a form of reducing our code length and improving the code's 
readability. 

CSS selectors are techniques used to reduce the code length and code repetition by 
grouping together elements, classes and ids based on similarity in both property and 
property value. 
----------------------------
Types of selectors:
(a) Multiple selectors
(b) Combined selectors
(c) Hierarchical selectors
----------------------------
Multiple selectors:
-> Definition:
    A multiple selector is a form of selector typically used when random html tags/elements 
    share the same property and property values. 

-> Form:
    selector1, selector2, ... {
        /* Property type and value */
    }

-> Explanation:
    When the web browser reads the css file, it will apply the property and its value to all 
    elements specified as part of the selector. 
----------------------------
Combined selectors:
-> Definition:
    A combined selector is a form of selectors that is typically used to affect all elements across 
    the html file that have the same id or class. 

-> Form:
    selector1[. | #]selector2 {
        /* Property type and value */
    }

-> Explanation:
    You typically associate a generic html tag with either an ID or a class. 
    You typically read the association from left to right. 
    The property affects all html tags with the same tag name [id | class] as the one 
    specified in the css file. 
----------------------------
Hierarchical selectors:
-> Definition:
    This form of selectors is one that is used to specify the exact position of the element 
    that we would like to apply the css properties to. 

-> Form:
    parent child ... target element {
        /* Property type and value*/
    }

-> Explanation:
    The machine typically reads this form of selection from right to left. 
    The leftmost element is the target element. 
    As you move to the left, you are going up the hierarchy in the html file. 
    The property is applied to all elements in the html file that have the same 
    parent..child association.

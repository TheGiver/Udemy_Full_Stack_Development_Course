Lecture Title: Media Query Breakpoints(MQB)
--------------------------------------------
Introduction:
To increase google's ranking for our website, our webpages need to be responsive and mobile friendly. 
If not, then our ranking will decrease and our webpage would not make it to the top of the list. 
One of the current issues that we are facing with our website is that both the photo and the text no 
longer appear in a user-friendly way when the web browser's size decreases in size. 
--------------------------------------------
Testing a website's mobile friendliness:
As we have mentioned before, having a responsive website will help you with your google ratings, which 
will in return push your website up the ranks so that it makes the first page. 

If you would like to check how well your website meets google's specifications, then search the following
on google:
'test mobile friendliness'
--------------------------------------------
Solution(s):
(a) The first solution towards building a website that is friendly across all devices is to build a separate 
    website that accommodates to the specifications of each device [pc, tablets, phones]. An example of a company 
    that have used this approach is facebook. 

    When you search for facebook on a web browser on any device, facebook will redirect you to a different website 
    depending on the device that you are currently using. 

(b) The second approach, the most recommended approach, is to build a website that is responsive.

Definition of Media Query Breakpoints:
MQB is a technique to customize your webpage depending on the medium being used to view the content of the 
webpage. For instance, if you wanted the layout of the page or the color of the text to differ on different 
platforms, then MQB is the way to go. 

One thing to note is that MQB is pure CSS and does not require the use of Bootstrap. 
--------------------------------------------
More About MQB:
I have to emphasize on the fact that using MQB is similar to the use of conditional statements in programming 
languages. This feature essentially allows us to apply a segment of code when a certain medium is being used. 
For instance, if we want the text color to be red on mobile but yellow on pc, then MQB is the way to go. 

The structure of MQB is as follows:
@media <type> <feature> { \\code }

The details of usage can be read from the official documentation.

Observation:
It is important to note the difference between the viewport and screen size.
(a) Screen size is the actual size of the screen of the device. This is static. 
(b) Viewport is the size of the webpage. This can change since we can manually change the size 
    of the web browser on our laptops.

Lecture Title: Manage Attention

Human psychology to our advantage:
Human tend to be drawn to objects that are larger in size and ones 
that stand out more due to color contraction. 

Now that we know this fact, we can use this when designing our webpages. 
You can either create a contrast which makes a certain object stand out 
or simply make the font bigger and bolder on the piece of text that matters
the most. In this way, you will make sure that the message reaches the client
in the fastest way possible.

Layout:
Always make sure that your layout is simple. Simplicity ensures ease of navigation 
which is a desirable trait.

Audience:
This is the most important thing to keep in mind when developing your website. 
All aspects of your website should be revolved around the target market and the 
audience you are trying to reach. The colors, the text, the content and the layout 
all needs to be appealing to the target audience.

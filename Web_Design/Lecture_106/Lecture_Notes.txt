Lecture Title: Putting Theory into Practice
-------------------------------------------
Introduction:
In this lecture we will be taking the design principles that we have been 
learning about all this time and put them into practise. 

The website that we will be using to design our webpages and apply 
our web design principles into practise is called canva.com

About canva.com:
This website allows you to design your webpage through the use of drag and drop 
features. 

It seems like a very interesting website, easy to use and navigate and you can 
create very interesting templates using it. 

I am going to use it when I refactor my code for my personal website and blog.

Lecture Title: Understanding Typography
---------------------------------------
Introduction:
As we have mentioned before, the font that you choose helps set the 
mood and aids in setting the theme of the website. Therefore, it is 
one essential element to consider when designing a webpage. 
------------------------------------------
Consequences of choosing the wrong font:
The consequences of choosing the wrong font are:
a. setting the wrong mood
b. delivering the wrong message
------------------------------------------
Main families:
There exists 2 main font families that we need to know and those are:
a. Serif
b. San-Serif

--> Serif family:
This family consists of font that tend to be more bold and authoratitive in 
nature. 

They are most suited for scenarios where you want some piece of text to stand 
out from the rest of the data presented on the webpage. 

For instance, this family would be good to use when attempting to write down the 
title of an article or a heading in a newspapaer, etc. You get the idea. 

--> San-serif family:
This text tends to be more friendly, more readible and legible. 

It is most suited for scenarios where you want to hit the reader with a large piece 
of text.

Advice:
One thing the lecturer has informed us is not to overwhelm the website with a variety 
of fonts as it will make the website look less professional.

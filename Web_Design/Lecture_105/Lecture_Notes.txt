Lecture Title: User Experience (UX) Design
------------------------------------------
Definition of UX:
So far, everything we have done was revolved around user interface design. 
We have learnt how to layout and design webpages but we have never considered 
the user's feelings when using the application. This part is considered to be 
part of the UX design. 

UX refers to the experience that the user experiences whilst using the web application.

Simplicity:
Again, simplicity is key. The simpler the design, the easier it is to navigate the website, 
the higher the user satisfaction.

Layout Approaches:
There exists 2 main layouts that tend to be used by designers when setting the layout for their 
website. Those layouts are:
a. The F-layout 
b. The Z-layout

--> The F-layout:
This layout aims to present the most important information in an F like pattern and this is mainly 
due to the way humans tend to skim through websites. 

So if you follow the lines of the letter F and present your most essential data on those lines, then 
you will increase the chance that your client would grasp the most useful information first and hopefully 
that would be sufficient for them to observe how trust-worthy and useful your website is. 

This pattern is usually evident in websites that presents news and articles to their clients. 

--> The Z-layout:
This layout tends to present the most important information along the horizontal lines of the letter Z. 
This layout tends to be used in cases where you have a piece of media to present to the users in the 
diagonal line zone, hence the rest of the info need to be present on the horizontal ones.

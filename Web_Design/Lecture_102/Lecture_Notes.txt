Lecture Title: Understanding Colour Theory
------------------------------------------
Definition:
Colour theory is the study of colours, their psychological effects on humans, 
the emotions they convey and their mixability with other colours. 
------------------------------------------
Choosing colour for your website:
The colours you chose for your website must match the theme, the atmosphere 
and the messages that you are trying to convery to the target audience. Otherwise,
your website might end up being off-putting and lose a lot of its attractiveness. 

Also, please make sure that your theme matches the target market you are operating 
in. Otherwise, you might risk losing potential clients. 
------------------------------------------
Colour definition:
Different colours have different meanings and you can always check those definitions
by going online.

Complementary vs Analogus colours:
Usually when you go around building a website you will find yourself using multiple 
colours to break the monotony of the website and to make it look more attractive and 
easier on the eye. When it comes to mixing colours, there are 2 concepts or techniques 
that you need to be aware off and those are:
a. Complementary colours:
Complementary colours are ones that sit on opposite sides of the colour wheel. 

b. Analogus colours:
Colours that sit on the same side/area of the colour wheel. 

Note:
One thing you need to be aware off is the idea of harmony. You essentially want to have 
harmony between the colours as it will make it easier on your clients' eyes and will make 
the website look more professional.

Text:
Another thing to keep in mind when building a website is to match the text with the theme 
you are trying to create and the emotions you are trying to convey. 

Having an illegible text will make it harder for your clients to read through your content 
and grasp the information. In addition, it is most likely that they are not going to fully 
browse your website.

Example on a professional website:
One good example of a website is Leibe Yoghurt's website.

Lecture Title: Working with JS Arrays
-------------------------------------
Introduction to arrays:
Arrays is one data of the basic and most important data structures 
used in programming. 

An array is essentially a collection of objects or data that can be 
accessed in O(1) time. The data can either be of the same or diff. types 
depending on the programming language being used. 

Usually an array occupies a block of memory on the RAM depending on the size
of the array at hand.

Array Usage Guide:
If you would like to define an array in JS, then you do the following:
                        var varName = []

If you would like to check the length of the array, then the '.length;' command 
should do the trick. 

If you would like to check whether an element exists in the array or not, then the 
'arr.includes(<Target Element)' is the way to go. This function return a boolean 
specifying whether the element has been found or not.

Challenge One:
In this challenge, we have been given a guest list and have been told that if the user's 
name exists in the list, then we return a specific message, else we return another message 
saying that their name is not on the list.

Lecture Title: Random Number Generator
--------------------------------------
Generating Random Numbers:
JS has a function that is part of the Maths library that allows you to generate
psudo random numbers in the range [0 .. 1). 
--------------------------------------
Scaling up to a specific range:
If you would like to scale the results up to a specific range then all you have to 
do is multiply the random number you receive by the max range you would like to achieve. 

For instance, if you want to generate a random number between 1 and 6, then all you have 
to do is call Math.random(), store the result in a variable (x) and then multiply x by 6. 

Then, you would have to round down the number to ensure that you get integer and not floating
point values.

Challenge 1:
We were asked to build a love calculator that takes the names of the 2 people we would like to 
match and then generates a random percentage that should represent how matching the couples are.

Lecture Title: The Dice Challenge
---------------------------------
Challenge Specifications:
We were given a challenge to build a website from scratch. The website must look similar to or 
identical to the one shown in the lecture. 

The website is essentially a small, simple and a basic game that is played by continiously refreshing
the page. On each refresh, 2 dice are going to be thrown at random and whichever is bigger, the player 
representing the die will win.

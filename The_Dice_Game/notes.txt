Topic: The Dice Challenge
Subtopic: Design Decisions 
------------------------------------------
Task Details:
We have been asked to create a webpage that is similar to or identical to the sample provided at the 
start of the section. 

The webpage simulates a game played by 2 players where each player throws a die and depending on the 
number that is on top, a player either wins, looses or draws. 
------------------------------------------
Design Decision 1.0.0:
According to the sample provided, it seems like the values of the dice will change everytime the user 
hits refresh. 

The way that I am thinking of doing it is to have a button that will simulate the same action that the 
refresh button does.
